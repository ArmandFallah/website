Hi, I'm Armand 👋🏻

I'm a high school senior with a passion for computer science, driven by
competition, creativity, and a critical thinking approach. I'm fueled by a deep
love for technology and a desire to build the future.

In my free time I like to explore the outdoors, play ice hockey, and work on
programming projects.

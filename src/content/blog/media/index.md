- Frontend: Typescript, React.js, CSS, SSE
- Backend: node.js, express.js, postgresql

My journey with media began during the summer of 2023. I was fresh out of Junior
year and had just started a one month stay in New York City with my brother.
During the school year, I had decided that I wanted to go into web development,
as it was the most interesting and applicable field for me. When I started that
summer, I only had a basic knowledge of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I determined
that I would make a simplified clone of Twitter, as it was mostly text and I
already had an idea of how to build it.

My first iteration of media was made entirely with vanilla JS, and HTML. There
was no backend, so everything was stored on the browser. Over my first attempt,
I learned about the DOM, how to sustain a project across multiple files, how to
employ callbacks, and more. But my second try is where I really began to grow. I
planned to be able to host my second version on the web, so I needed to develop
a backend as well. After some research, I constructed a plan to make my website.
I would have a React frontend, API built with Node.js, and a PostgreSQL backend.
I started by learning basic syntax, hooks, and relevant libraries. I rebuilt the
application with React, still running on the browser, then moved towards the
backend. I started with the database, where I made a table to store the data of
the "tweets".

My next step would be the hardest of the process for me, the API. Moving from
frontend development to backend development was a tough step to take for me.
Learning the protocol and required libraries and technologies was the hardest
task in the entire process for me. At one point there were three days straight
where I made minimal to no progress, but after almost a week of inching forward,
I finally had my backend working. Finally being able to see the culmination of a
month's work was an unforgettable moment for me. I will always remember jumping
around the room when I saw my page update. I'm still in disbelief that I was
able to complete a project that once seemed impossible, but I can't stop myself
from thinking whats coming next.
